# ðŸ“‚ Feature Selection in Machine Learning ðŸŽ¯

ðŸš€ Boost Model Performance by Selecting the Right Features!# Feature-Selection


## ðŸŒŸ Why Feature Selection?

Feature Selection is a crucial step in the Machine Learning pipeline that:
* âœ… Improves Model Performance by removing irrelevant features.
* âœ… Reduces Overfitting by eliminating noisy data.
* âœ… Speeds Up Computation by lowering dimensionality.
* âœ… Enhances Interpretability of the model.

ðŸŽ¯ Good features make good models!
